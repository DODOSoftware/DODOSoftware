- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul from non-yet-existance one-man-it-company, that I named DODOSoftware.
Name "Dodo" comes from alias of my little daughter, the alias she loves :) She's the main reason I'm trying to change my current job, 
from physiotherapist to a programmer. It's May 2022 when I write this, and I started 2 months back - so please be understanding, if you're reading my code :)

- 👀 I’m interested in ---
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... everything I guess? Started with freeCodeCamp HTML and CSS, now I learn Python basics. Wish me luck :D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ---
- 📫 You can reach me via e-mail janas.pj@gmail.com
